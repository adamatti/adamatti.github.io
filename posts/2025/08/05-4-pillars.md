I just watched [this presentation](https://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/people-process-tech-business.html) from Anna Shipman:

Alex Ewerl√∂f presents it as [t-pop](https://blog.alexewerlof.com/p/t-pop) framework:

And this is also how Patrick Kua defines the [engineering manager archetypes](https://www.patkua.com/blog/5-engineering-manager-archetypes/):

When I started as [a manager in 2019](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamatti/), one mentor explained to me those 4 pillars. You can't focus in just one or two to grow as manager. Neither as tech lead or software engineer.

I used it a lot to interview people and conduce team retrospectives.
