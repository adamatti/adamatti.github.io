I just expended some time to play with [memcached](https://memcached.org/). My github repo is [here](https://github.com/adamatti/learn-memcached).

My takes:
- if you are familiar with Redis, it is almost the same
- Redis offers more features like advanced data structures and persistence, while Memcached is simpler and faster for basic caching
  - full comparison [here](https://grok.com/share/bGVnYWN5_60674093-56e1-43bd-afe2-03e6bba20a81) (from grok)
- [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhM2ByShhzE) explains a lot
