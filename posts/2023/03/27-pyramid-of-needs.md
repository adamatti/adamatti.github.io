Today I received the [Refactoring newsletter](https://refactoring.fm/p/on-design-sweet-spot-threat-modeling) (which strongly recommend to sign in), and one of the sections caused me some reflections, the "Pyramid of Needs".

While I had previously heard of [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs), this pyramid is specifically relevant to one's career.

This is the image from the post:

... and I strongly recommend you (reader) to go to the [original post]((https://refactoring.fm/p/on-design-sweet-spot-threat-modeling) ) to check all the details.

- The majority of the professional that I knew were more interested (or stuck) in the *individual* layer. 
- The best ones (that I know, IMHO) passed the *Teamwork* layer.
- I was 200% in the item *I have opportunities to learn and grow*. But it doesn't work if the *teamwork* layer (and the ones bellow) aren't fulfilled.
