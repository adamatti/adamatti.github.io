One more year I participated on [The Dev Conf](https://thedevconf.com/tdc/2023/future/trilha-api) as a track coordinator, API this time. One more row to [my profile there](https://thedevconf.com/palestrante/MarceloAdamatti).

We had talks about:

- Legacy of Microservices
- REST controllers
- Governance
- Contract tests
- Open Telemetry
- API Gateway
- GraphQL

We had great feedback score from the audience (lowest avg vote was 4.3 of 5).

#### To the speaker and track coordinators

Thanks a lot for all the efforts, dedication, time expended... We had a great event, it wouldn't be possible without that.

#### To event coordinators

Thanks for pick me, it is a recognition of my work.

#### To the audience

I hope everyone enjoined as the feedback scored said. TDC is a community event, we did the talk selection based on what we thought would be the best for the audience. It is not easy to pick 7 from a good amount of submissions.

#### To myself in future

It is a lot of work/coordination prior the event: people will cancel, have problems with the time of the slot, etc. But during and in the pass, the event is a great experience.
