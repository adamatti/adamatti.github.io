I saw this in a webinar:

> A Sports Illustrated article reports that 78% of NFL players and 60% of NBA players face serious financial hardships after retirement ([source](https://www.abi.org/feed-item/how-athletes-go-bankrupt-at-an-alarming-rate))

> Sports Illustrated [estimates](https://vault.si.com/vault/2009/03/23/how-and-why-athletes-go-broke) 78% of NFL players face financial trouble within two years of leaving the game, and another 60% of NBA players are in the same boat five years after retirement ([source](https://cyndeowp.com/the-five-main-reasons-professional-athletes-go-broke/))

## My take on this?

It is not how much you earn, it is about how you expend it.

You need to know the difference about active asset and passive asset.
