I received a newsletter today, [Which IDEs do software engineers love, and why?](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/ide-that-software-engineers-love/).

The top IDE in the list is [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/). I am playing with it, it seems amazing.

The AI integration with the code is seamless, good feedbacks, fast, good suggestions. And it is a vscode fork, so I can use all my plugins.

I am super impressed, I will play with it for a while and see how it goes.
