When the war stopped and the army left, they repeated the same actions to keep receiving the gifts.\n\nWhat message do you think we could take from this?\n\n### If we don't know WHY we are doing something, we are not going to receive the benefits\n\nIn the agile context:\n\n- If you don't know why we do retros, the team will not get better\n- If you don't know why we do stand up / daily meetings, you may not have address communication and collaboration issues\n\nIn the tools context:\n\n- If you don't know how \"the tool\" works and which problems it solves, you may introduce new issues\n  - Some samples: kafka/kubernetes/microservices/graphql/etc\n\nIn the finance context:\n\n- If you don't know how the market works, you may buy on high and sell on low\n- If you don't know about Bitcoin, you may lose money\n\nWe can go on and on, about weight loss, metrics, entrepreneurship...\n\nUsing Steve Jobs shirts will not make you rich...\n\nNeither wake up at 4 am...\n\nNeither cold showers...\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
