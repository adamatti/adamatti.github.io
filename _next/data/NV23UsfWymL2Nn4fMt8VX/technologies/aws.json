I can even add it to my existing scripts.\n\nWe can also [export it to .env file](https://docs.commonfate.io/granted/usage/dotenv):\n\n```\nassume role-a --env\n```\n\nPlus, [we can access different profiles in different browser tabs](https://docs.commonfate.io/granted/usage/console):\n\n```\nassume -c <role>\n```\n\nSuper useful, highly recommended."}],"events":[],"technologies":[{"id":"11","name":"AWS","color":"orange-400","image":"ec2.png","tags":["platform"],"since":"2015-09-16T00:00:00.000Z"}],"videos":[],"petProjects":[{"id":"639096142","name":"learn-rds","url":"https://github.com/adamatti/learn-rds","description":"Pet project to play with AWS RDS","createdAt":"2023-05-10T18:48:55Z","language":"HCL","topics":["aws","rds","terraform"]},{"id":"383848508","name":"terraform-like","url":"https://github.com/adamatti/terraform-like","description":"Pet project to create AWS artifacts (e.g. s3, sqs, dynamo) on localstack","createdAt":"2021-07-07T15:42:06Z","language":"JavaScript","topics":["aws","javascript","js","terraform"]},{"id":"181769985","name":"LearnAws","url":"https://github.com/adamatti/LearnAws","description":"Pet project to play with AWS services with java on local box","createdAt":"2019-04-16T21:28:13Z","language":"Groovy","topics":["aws","docker","gradle","java","jvm"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
