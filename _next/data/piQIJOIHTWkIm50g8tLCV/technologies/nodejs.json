To create a sample and deploy there, you just need to run one single command:\n\n```\npnpm create cloudflare@latest <project name>\n```\n\n... and of course, a lot of prompts.\n\nI removed some dead code (editor config, prettier), added [biome](https://biomejs.dev/), added a [taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/) (I will forget the commands). Also played with [Hono](https://github.com/honojs/hono) - the web framework [suggested by Cloudflare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7Qe96fqg1M) and added an AI endpoint.\n\nPretty simple, reminds me the good old days with the free [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) tier.\n\nFor sure I will consider it for my pet projects.\n\nMy full code is available on [github](https://github.com/adamatti/learn-cf-worker).\n\nNext, I will try it with [remix](https://remix.run/) for a full stack experience.\n"},{"slug":"2024-09-06-yarn","title":"Yarn Classic","summary":"It is time to move on","dateString":"2024-09-06","tags":["javascript","nodejs"],"content":"\nHey, are you using [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com)? Great tool from [Facebook](https://facebook.com), right?\n\nBut how are you installing it?\n\n`npm install -g yarn`?\n\n### I have a bad news to tell you...\n\n> Yarn has not been distributed on npm since 2019 because of breaking changes that could impact deployments - Google AI\n\nand\n\n> Those versions entered maintenance mode in January 2020 - [yarn classic website](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install)\n\n### So, what should I do?\n\nNeed to consider a better/newer package manager.\n\nIt could be:\n\n- [the new yarn version](https://yarnpkg.com/): as of today (09/06), it is on version 4.4.1\n- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/), the faster alternative\n- [The NPM itself](https://www.npmjs.com/). The official tool. In 2024, it is faster than yarn classic\n\nThere are a lot of benchmarks out there, like:\n\n- https://romanglushach.medium.com/comparing-npm-yarn-and-pnpm-package-managers-which-one-is-right-for-your-distributed-project-to-4d7de2f0db8e\n- https://refine.dev/blog/pnpm-vs-npm-and-yarn\n- https://www.dhiwise.com/post/pnpm-vs-npm-vs-yarn-which-javascript-package-manager\n\n### How about me?\n\nI am using [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) in my latest projects, both pet and professional, but already had some issues with it.\n\nIt all case by case, but I strongly recommend to use [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) for fast local builds and CI.\n"}],"events":[],"technologies":[],"videos":[{"id":"37","title":"Hypermedia APIs com harvesterjs","description":"How to create hypermedia APIs with this custom framework","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIONwSrc-Rk","embedId":"HIONwSrc","tags":["nodejs","javascript"]}],"petProjects":[{"id":"563889212","name":"lambda_unzip","url":"https://github.com/adamatti/lambda_unzip","description":"This is a pet project, just a lambda(nodejs) to unzip files on s3","createdAt":"2022-11-09T14:51:44Z","language":"HCL","topics":["javascript","js","lambda","nodejs","terraform"]},{"id":"557864566","name":"mysql_to_redshift","url":"https://github.com/adamatti/mysql_to_redshift","description":"Small script to load mysql data to redshift","createdAt":"2022-10-26T12:59:09Z","language":"TypeScript","topics":["javascript","js","mysql","nodejs","redshift","typescript"]},{"id":"476452035","name":"github-actions-test","url":"https://github.com/adamatti/github-actions-test","description":"Pet projet to learn github actions","createdAt":"2022-03-31T19:37:13Z","language":"JavaScript","topics":["javascript","js","nodejs"]},{"id":"342653921","name":"LearnZipkin","url":"https://github.com/adamatti/LearnZipkin","description":"Pet project to learn zipkin (tracing)","createdAt":"2021-02-26T17:44:08Z","language":"Go","topics":["golang","java","javascript","js","jvm","nodejs"]},{"id":"218808514","name":"talk_microservices_apis","url":"https://github.com/adamatti/talk_microservices_apis","description":"Talk apresentada no meetup de microservices em 30/10/2019","createdAt":"2019-10-31T16:18:55Z","language":"Groovy","topics":["docker","golang","graphql","groovy","grpc","micronaut","microservice","microservices","nodejs","rest-api","restql"]},{"id":"171135990","name":"json-server-api","url":"https://github.com/adamatti/json-server-api","description":"Based on json-server, but with plans to expand","createdAt":"2019-02-17T15:08:42Z","language":"TypeScript","topics":["graphql","javascript","js","nodejs","typescript"]},{"id":"155613119","name":"LearnSonar","url":"https://github.com/adamatti/LearnSonar","description":"Pet project to show how to publish metrics to sonar","createdAt":"2018-10-31T19:35:00Z","language":"Java","topics":["gradle","groovy","java","javascript","js","jvm","nodejs","sonar","sonarqube","typescript"]},{"id":"106339054","name":"LearnKafka","url":"https://github.com/adamatti/LearnKafka","description":"Pet project to test kafka client","createdAt":"2017-10-09T21:51:02Z","language":"Groovy","topics":["groovy","javascript","kafka","nodejs"]},{"id":"105092667","name":"express-actuator-alt","url":"https://github.com/adamatti/express-actuator-alt","description":"Plugin based on express-actuator to work with spring-boot-admin","createdAt":"2017-09-28T02:26:33Z","language":"JavaScript","topics":["expressjs","javascript","nodejs","npm","spring"]},{"id":"103082352","name":"LearnLerna","url":"https://github.com/adamatti/LearnLerna","description":"Pet project to learn Lerna","createdAt":"2017-09-11T02:49:54Z","language":"JavaScript","topics":["javascript","lernajs","monorepo","nodejs"]},{"id":"99867780","name":"SandboxNode","url":"https://github.com/adamatti/SandboxNode","description":"Nodejs experiments","createdAt":"2017-08-10T01:31:36Z","language":"JavaScript","topics":["express","javascript","nodejs"]},{"id":"91861861","name":"LearnHubot","url":"https://github.com/adamatti/LearnHubot","description":"Pet project to learn Hubot","createdAt":"2017-05-20T03:11:27Z","language":"JavaScript","topics":["chatbot","hubot","javascript","js","nodejs"]},{"id":"88857373","name":"LearnNode","url":"https://github.com/adamatti/LearnNode","description":"Pet project to play with node","createdAt":"2017-04-20T11:19:54Z","language":"JavaScript","topics":["javascript","js","nodejs"]},{"id":"61900907","name":"LearnRabbitMQ","url":"https://github.com/adamatti/LearnRabbitMQ","description":"Pet project to play with RabbitMQ","createdAt":"2016-06-24T17:26:24Z","language":"JavaScript","topics":["javascript","js","nodejs","rabbitmq"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
