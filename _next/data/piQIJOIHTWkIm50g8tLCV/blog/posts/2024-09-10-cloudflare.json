To create a sample and deploy there, you just need to run one single command:\n\n```\npnpm create cloudflare@latest <project name>\n```\n\n... and of course, a lot of prompts.\n\nI removed some dead code (editor config, prettier), added [biome](https://biomejs.dev/), added a [taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/) (I will forget the commands). Also played with [Hono](https://github.com/honojs/hono) - the web framework [suggested by Cloudflare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7Qe96fqg1M) and added an AI endpoint.\n\nPretty simple, reminds me the good old days with the free [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) tier.\n\nFor sure I will consider it for my pet projects.\n\nMy full code is available on [github](https://github.com/adamatti/learn-cf-worker).\n\nNext, I will try it with [remix](https://remix.run/) for a full stack experience.\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
