Secondly, by using **throw** you make the assumption that the caller of your function is implementing **catch**. This is a known source of errors. Example: One dev **throw**s and another dev uses the function without prior knowledge that the function will throw. Thus, and edge case has been left unhandled and now you have unhappy users, bosses, cats, etc.\n\n> With all that said, there are definitely good use cases for throwing in your program. But much less than you might think.\n\n## Would I use it in a production code (javascript/typescript)?\n\nProbably not as it changes the way the language was designed. A lot of frameworks/libs/integrations expect the code to throw on error (e.g. sentry, datadog, [express](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/error-handling.html)).\n\nUse [golang](https://go.dev/) instead. \n\nBut definitely I would use it for pet projects, to make the code more functional and avoid **goto** calls."}]},"__N_SSG":true}
