But after some years it was becoming show, and since I love to try new things I decided to explore new shell options.\n\nTL/DR: I am using [fish](https://fishshell.com/) now. Why?\n\n- It seems faster, at least in those first days / fresh install\n- I was using [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh) mainly for aliases (e.g. [git](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/plugins/git/README.md)), but [abbreviations are much better for history and share commands](https://www.sean.sh/log/when-an-alias-should-actually-be-an-abbr/).\n- Auto complete seems to works better + syntax highlight\n- Functions (super easy syntax)\n- All the things that I was using continue to work as expected (e.g. [mise](/blog/posts/2024-09-24-mise), [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide), etc). No reason to not work, but worth to mention\n- Saw others moving from zsh to fish, it seems a natural moving\n- [11 reasons here](https://itsfoss.com/fish-shell-features/)\n\n# Super quick start\n\n```bash\n# Install fish on OSX\nbrew install fish\n\n# Add it to possible terminals\ncode /etc/shells\n# Manually add /opt/homebrew/bin/fish (ok, could do it with echo but choose not to)\n\n# Change default terminal\nchsh -s /opt/homebrew/bin/fish\n\n# Have fun\n```\n\n# Customizations\n\n- I installed [fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) to add extensions, but didn't find a need for it yet. [Auto pair](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/autopair.fish) is the only one active\n  - [fish-abbreviation-tips](https://github.com/gazorby/fish-abbreviation-tips) is great, but since switched aliases for [abbreviations](https://www.sean.sh/log/when-an-alias-should-actually-be-an-abbr/) it doesn't make sense anymore.\n- For themes and colors I was using [starship](https://starship.rs/). Decided to stick on it for now, configs [here](https://github.com/adamatti/dotfiles/tree/main/starship).\n- [Abbreviations!](https://www.sean.sh/log/when-an-alias-should-actually-be-an-abbr/) You can create it even for parameters and can edit the commands prior to execute.\n\n# Next\n\n- Join [reddit group](https://www.reddit.com/r/fishshell/)\n- Take a look on [fisher plugins](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/awsm.fish#readme), [github repos](https://github.com/topics/fish), etc\n- Add a star in the [fish-shell](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) repo\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
