It is great because:\n\n### 1. It does respect the other format configurations\n\n`.ruby-version`? `.nvmrc`? We don't need to change existing projects to use it.\n\n### 2. It is easy to install\n\n`mise install` in an existing app, `mise use node@lts` / `mise use deno@latest` / etc to add a new dependency.\n\nYou can also install global ones, like `mise use --global opentofu@latest`\n\n### 3. Easy to check required versions\n\nJust run `mise ls`\n\n### 4. Easy to upgrade all\n\n`mise up`\n\n### 5. It has hundreds of integrations\n\nCheck it all at [here](https://mise.jdx.dev/plugins.html)\n\n### Others\n\nIt does integrate with bash / zsh for auto version switch (switch on cd).\n\nIt does support environment vars control and task automation, but I do prefer other tools for that.\n\nI hope you enjoy it, let me know your thoughts in the comments.\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
