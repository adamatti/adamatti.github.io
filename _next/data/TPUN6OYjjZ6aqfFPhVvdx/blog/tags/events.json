One more row to [my profile there](https://thedevconf.com/palestrante/MarceloAdamatti).\n\nWe had talks about:\n\n- Legacy of Microservices\n- REST controllers\n- Governance\n- Contract tests\n- Open Telemetry\n- API Gateway\n- GraphQL\n\nWe had great feedback score from the audience (lowest avg vote was 4.3 of 5).\n\nThe photos are available [here](https://thedevconf.com/tdc/2022/future/fotos).\n\n#### To the speaker and track coordinators\n\nThanks a lot for all the efforts, dedication, time expended... We had a great event, it wouldn't be possible without that.\n\n#### To event coordinators\n\nThanks for pick me, it is a recognition of my work.\n\n#### To the audience\n\nI hope everyone enjoined as the feedback scored said. TDC is a community event, we did the talk selection based on what we thought would be the best for the audience. It is not easy to pick 7 from a good amount of submissions.\n\n#### To myself in future\n\nIt is a lot of work/coordination prior the event: people will cancel, have problems with the time of the slot, etc. But during and in the pass, the event is a great experience."}]},"__N_SSG":true}
