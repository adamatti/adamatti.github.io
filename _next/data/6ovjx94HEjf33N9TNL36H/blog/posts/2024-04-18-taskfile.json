I spoke about then in the [last post](/blog/posts/2024-04-08-makefile).\n\nBut what if:\n\n- I want to break them in different files\n- Use a better syntax (maybe yaml?)\n- Cache the tasks, even the ones that don't generate artifacts (e.g. lint)\n- put tasks and aliases close\n- validate the task execution\n- have global tasks to run in any folder (e.g. backup)\n- dry run\n- watch task\n\n#### Taskfile to rescue\n\nJust need to [install Task](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) (or go-task on [github](https://github.com/go-task/task)).\n\nThe [documentation](https://taskfile.dev/) is pretty simple IMHO, but I want to highlight some things that I do use in daily bases that I think it does a great difference.\n\n## Show me the code\n\nFor this I will use the sample from [previous post](/blog/posts/2024-04-08-makefile) ([makefile here](https://github.com/adamatti/node-sample/blob/main/Makefile))\n\n```yaml\n# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://json.schemastore.org/taskfile.json\n---\nversion: '3'\n\nenv:\n  DATABASE_URL: postgres://postgres:sample@localhost:5432/sample\n\nincludes:\n  docker-compose:\n    aliases: [dc]\n    taskfile: ./Taskfile-docker-compose.yaml\n  prisma:\n    aliases: [p]\n    taskfile: ./Taskfile-prisma.yaml\n\ntasks:\n  default:\n    desc: Show help\n    aliases: [h]\n    silent: true\n    cmds:\n      - task -l --sort alphanumeric\n\n  clean:\n    desc: Remove node modules\n    aliases: [c]\n    cmds:\n      - rm -rf node-modules\n\n  install:\n    desc: Install dependencies\n    aliases: [i]\n    run: once\n    cmds:\n      - npm install\n    preconditions:\n      - test -f package.json\n      - test -f package-lock.json\n    sources:\n      - package.json\n      - package-lock.json\n    status:\n      - test -d node_modules\n\n  run-only:\n    aliases: [ro]\n    interactive: true\n    ignore_error: true\n    dotenv: ['.env']\n    cmds:\n      - task: install\n      - task: prisma:generate\n      - npx --yes esno src/index.ts\n\n  run:\n    desc: Run the project\n    aliases: [r]\n    cmds:\n      - task: docker-compose:up\n      - task: prisma:push\n      - task: run-only\n```\n\nThere are a lot of things going on here, so trying to explain some things:\n\n1. The first line is just for auto complete on IDEs (like vscode, zed)\n2. We can define global env vars in the script itself (e.g. `DATABASE_URL`)\n3. We can [import](https://taskfile.dev/usage/#including-other-taskfiles) part of the scripts. You just need to have your global ones (e.g. terraform, docker-compose, prisma, git, etc). It does work with remote files.\n4. You can expose/hide tasks with [internal flag](https://taskfile.dev/usage/#internal-tasks)\n\n## Now the best part - cache\n\nPay a close look on the install task.\n\n1. it only runs if `package.json` and `package-lock.json` are present ([programatic checks](https://taskfile.dev/usage/#using-programmatic-checks-to-cancel-the-execution-of-a-task-and-its-dependencies))\n2. [Prevent unnecessary work](https://taskfile.dev/usage/#prevent-unnecessary-work): it caches the execution using the `source` attribute.\n3. at the end it checks if the `node_modules` folder was created.\n4. Even caching based on the `source`, if you remove the `node_modules` folder (check) it will run again.\n\n## Ok, show me a normal day of work\n\nAt the first time, you just need to run `task r` to run the app. It will install dependencies, start database, apply db changes and run the app.\n\nBut what happen if someone changes a dependency? No problem. Taskfile will detect and will run `npm install` again.\n\nBut if someone just changes the db schema? No problem. It will generate the classes again.\n\nIf nothing changes, it will just run the app (ok, the docker part is not optimized, but you got the idea).\n\nIf need to stop the app and run again you can go direct to `task ro` (ro = run only).\n\n## Full Project\n\nAs always, the full sample is available on [github](https://github.com/adamatti/node-sample).\n\n## Closing thoughts\n\nNow go to the [documentation](https://taskfile.dev/usage/).\n\nRemove commands from `README.md` files and confluence/sharepoint. Also remove it for anemic `package.json` ðŸ˜›\n\nMy global taskfiles are shared [here](https://github.com/adamatti/dotfiles/tree/main/taskfile) for reference.\n\nMy backup scripts using rsync are also on taskfiles, but this is a subject for another post.\n\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
