I can even add it to my existing scripts.\n\nWe can also [export it to .env file](https://docs.commonfate.io/granted/usage/dotenv):\n\n```\nassume role-a --env\n```\n\nPlus, [we can access different profiles in different browser tabs](https://docs.commonfate.io/granted/usage/console):\n\n```\nassume -c <role>\n```\n\nSuper useful, highly recommended."}},"__N_SSG":true}
