Great tool from [Facebook](https://facebook.com), right?\n\nBut how are you installing it?\n\n`npm install -g yarn`?\n\n### I have a bad news to tell you...\n\n> Yarn has not been distributed on npm since 2019 because of breaking changes that could impact deployments - Google AI\n\nand\n\n> Those versions entered maintenance mode in January 2020 - [yarn classic website](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install)\n\n### So, what should I do?\n\nNeed to consider a better/newer package manager.\n\nIt could be:\n\n- [the new yarn version](https://yarnpkg.com/): as of today (09/06), it is on version 4.4.1\n- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/), the faster alternative\n- [The NPM itself](https://www.npmjs.com/). The official tool. In 2024, it is faster than yarn classic\n\nThere are a lot of benchmarks out there, like:\n\n- https://romanglushach.medium.com/comparing-npm-yarn-and-pnpm-package-managers-which-one-is-right-for-your-distributed-project-to-4d7de2f0db8e\n- https://refine.dev/blog/pnpm-vs-npm-and-yarn\n- https://www.dhiwise.com/post/pnpm-vs-npm-vs-yarn-which-javascript-package-manager\n\n### How about me?\n\nI am using [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) in my latest projects, both pet and professional, but already had some issues with it.\n\nIt all case by case, but I strongly recommend to use [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) for fast local builds and CI.\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
