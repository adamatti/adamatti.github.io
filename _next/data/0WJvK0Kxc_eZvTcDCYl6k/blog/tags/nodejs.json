To create a sample and deploy there, you just need to run one single command:\n\n```\npnpm create cloudflare@latest <project name>\n```\n\n... and of course, a lot of prompts.\n\nI removed some dead code (editor config, prettier), added [biome](https://biomejs.dev/), added a [taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/) (I will forget the commands). Also played with [Hono](https://github.com/honojs/hono) - the web framework [suggested by Cloudflare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7Qe96fqg1M) and added an AI endpoint.\n\nPretty simple, reminds me the good old days with the free [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) tier.\n\nFor sure I will consider it for my pet projects.\n\nMy full code is available on [github](https://github.com/adamatti/learn-cf-worker).\n\nNext, I will try it with [remix](https://remix.run/) for a full stack experience. If I got it right, it should be [super simple](https://hono.dev/examples/with-remix) (or [creating from scratch](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-remix-site/)).\n"},{"slug":"2024-09-06-yarn","title":"Yarn Classic","summary":"It is time to move on","dateString":"2024-09-06","tags":["javascript","nodejs"],"content":"\nHey, are you using [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com)? Great tool from [Facebook](https://facebook.com), right?\n\nBut how are you installing it?\n\n`npm install -g yarn`?\n\n### I have a bad news to tell you...\n\n> Yarn has not been distributed on npm since 2019 because of breaking changes that could impact deployments - Google AI\n\nand\n\n> Those versions entered maintenance mode in January 2020 - [yarn classic website](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install)\n\n### So, what should I do?\n\nNeed to consider a better/newer package manager.\n\nIt could be:\n\n- [the new yarn version](https://yarnpkg.com/): as of today (09/06), it is on version 4.4.1\n- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/), the faster alternative\n- [The NPM itself](https://www.npmjs.com/). The official tool. In 2024, it is faster than yarn classic\n\nThere are a lot of benchmarks out there, like:\n\n- https://romanglushach.medium.com/comparing-npm-yarn-and-pnpm-package-managers-which-one-is-right-for-your-distributed-project-to-4d7de2f0db8e\n- https://refine.dev/blog/pnpm-vs-npm-and-yarn\n- https://www.dhiwise.com/post/pnpm-vs-npm-vs-yarn-which-javascript-package-manager\n\n### How about me?\n\nI am using [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) in my latest projects, both pet and professional, but already had some issues with it.\n\nIt all case by case, but I strongly recommend to use [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) for fast local builds and CI.\n"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
