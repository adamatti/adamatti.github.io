But after some years it was becoming show, and since I love to try new things I decided to explore new shell options.\n\nTL/DR: I am using [fish](https://fishshell.com/) now. Why?\n\n- It seems faster, at least in those first days / fresh install\n- I was using [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh) mainly for aliases (e.g. [git](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/plugins/git/README.md)), but [abbreviations are much better for history and share commands](https://www.sean.sh/log/when-an-alias-should-actually-be-an-abbr/).\n- Auto complete seems to works better + syntax highlight\n- Functions (super easy syntax)\n- All the things that I was using continue to work as expected (e.g. [mise](/blog/posts/2024-09-24-mise), [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide), etc). No reason to not work, but worth to mention\n- Saw others moving from zsh to fish, it seems a natural moving\n- [11 reasons here](https://itsfoss.com/fish-shell-features/)\n\n# Super quick start\n\n```bash\n# Install fish on OSX\nbrew install fish\n\n# Add it to possible terminals\ncode /etc/shells\n# Manually add /opt/homebrew/bin/fish (ok, could do it with echo but choose not to)\n\n# Change default terminal\nchsh -s /opt/homebrew/bin/fish\n\n# Have fun\n```\n\n# Customizations\n\n- I installed [fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) to add extensions, but didn't find a need for it yet. [Auto pair](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/autopair.fish) is the only one active\n  - [fish-abbreviation-tips](https://github.com/gazorby/fish-abbreviation-tips) is great, but since switched aliases for [abbreviations](https://www.sean.sh/log/when-an-alias-should-actually-be-an-abbr/) it doesn't make sense anymore.\n- For themes and colors I was using [starship](https://starship.rs/). Decided to stick on it for now, configs [here](https://github.com/adamatti/dotfiles/tree/main/starship).\n- [Abbreviations!](https://www.sean.sh/log/when-an-alias-should-actually-be-an-abbr/) You can create it even for parameters and can edit the commands prior to execute.\n\n# Next\n\n- Join [reddit group](https://www.reddit.com/r/fishshell/)\n- Take a look on [fisher plugins](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/awsm.fish#readme), [github repos](https://github.com/topics/fish), etc\n- Add a star in the [fish-shell](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) repo\n"},{"slug":"2024-09-24-mise","title":"Mise: a version manager","summary":"A replacement for gvm, nvm, etc","dateString":"2024-09-24","tags":["tools"],"content":"\nI saw in twitter some time ago, I think it was suggested by [Akita](https://twitter.com/AkitaOnRails?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) - disclaimer: unable to check here as [twitter still blocked in Brazil](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y3rnl5qv3o) - about [mise](https://github.com/jdx/mise), a version manager.\n\nPreviously I was using [gvm](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm) for golang, [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) for node (it is like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), but faster), [sdkman](https://sdkman.io/) for java/jvm, some crazy tools for python/ruby, and [brew](https://brew.sh/) for the other (e.g. [bun](https://bun.sh/), [deno](https://deno.com/)).\n\nWith [mise](https://github.com/jdx/mise) I can use one tool for all. It is great because:\n\n### 1. It does respect the other format configurations\n\n`.ruby-version`? `.nvmrc`? We don't need to change existing projects to use it.\n\n### 2. It is easy to install\n\n`mise install` in an existing app, `mise use node@lts` / `mise use deno@latest` / etc to add a new dependency.\n\nYou can also install global ones, like `mise use --global opentofu@latest`\n\n### 3. Easy to check required versions\n\nJust run `mise ls`\n\n### 4. Easy to upgrade all\n\n`mise up`\n\n### 5. It has hundreds of integrations\n\nCheck it all at [here](https://mise.jdx.dev/plugins.html)\n\n### Others\n\nIt does integrate with bash / zsh for auto version switch (switch on cd).\n\nIt does support environment vars control and task automation, but I do prefer other tools for that.\n\nI hope you enjoy it, let me know your thoughts in the comments.\n"},{"slug":"2024-08-16-aws-granted","title":"AWS Granted","summary":"A tool to easily access AWS roles","dateString":"2024-08-16","tags":["aws","tools"],"content":"\nI was trying to find an alternative to [aws-sso-creds-helper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-sso-creds-helper) since it is archived/deprecated.\n\nThe \"official\" AWS solution is not great either (`aws sso login --profile <profile_name>`).\n\nMy coworkers are using [granted](https://docs.commonfate.io/granted/introduction). \n\nThe [installation](https://docs.commonfate.io/granted/getting-started#installing-the-cli) was simple:\n\n```\nbrew tap common-fate/granted\nbrew install granted\n```\n\nThe [configuration](https://docs.commonfate.io/granted/usage/automatic-config-generation#all-available-aws-sso-roles) was all auto generated:\n\n```\ngranted sso generate --sso-region ap-southeast-2 https://example.awsapps.com/start\n```\n\nAnd to use is basically `assume <role>`.

I spoke about then in the [last post](/blog/posts/2024-04-08-makefile).\n\nBut what if:\n\n- I want to break them in different files\n- Use a better syntax (maybe yaml?)\n- Cache the tasks, even the ones that don't generate artifacts (e.g. lint)\n- put tasks and aliases close\n- validate the task execution\n- have global tasks to run in any folder (e.g. backup)\n- dry run\n- watch task\n\n#### Taskfile to rescue\n\nJust need to [install Task](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) (or go-task on [github](https://github.com/go-task/task)).\n\nThe [documentation](https://taskfile.dev/) is pretty simple IMHO, but I want to highlight some things that I do use in daily bases that I think it does a great difference.\n\n## Show me the code\n\nFor this I will use the sample from [previous post](/blog/posts/2024-04-08-makefile) ([makefile here](https://github.com/adamatti/node-sample/blob/main/Makefile))\n\n```yaml\n# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://json.schemastore.org/taskfile.json\n---\nversion: '3'\n\nenv:\n  DATABASE_URL: postgres://postgres:sample@localhost:5432/sample\n\nincludes:\n  docker-compose:\n    aliases: [dc]\n    taskfile: ./Taskfile-docker-compose.yaml\n  prisma:\n    aliases: [p]\n    taskfile: ./Taskfile-prisma.yaml\n\ntasks:\n  default:\n    desc: Show help\n    aliases: [h]\n    silent: true\n    cmds:\n      - task -l --sort alphanumeric\n\n  clean:\n    desc: Remove node modules\n    aliases: [c]\n    cmds:\n      - rm -rf node-modules\n\n  install:\n    desc: Install dependencies\n    aliases: [i]\n    run: once\n    cmds:\n      - npm install\n    preconditions:\n      - test -f package.json\n      - test -f package-lock.json\n    sources:\n      - package.json\n      - package-lock.json\n    status:\n      - test -d node_modules\n\n  run-only:\n    aliases: [ro]\n    interactive: true\n    ignore_error: true\n    dotenv: ['.env']\n    cmds:\n      - task: install\n      - task: prisma:generate\n      - npx --yes esno src/index.ts\n\n  run:\n    desc: Run the project\n    aliases: [r]\n    cmds:\n      - task: docker-compose:up\n      - task: prisma:push\n      - task: run-only\n```\n\nThere are a lot of things going on here, so trying to explain some things:\n\n1. The first line is just for auto complete on IDEs (like vscode, zed)\n2. We can define global env vars in the script itself (e.g. `DATABASE_URL`)\n3. We can [import](https://taskfile.dev/usage/#including-other-taskfiles) part of the scripts. You just need to have your global ones (e.g. terraform, docker-compose, prisma, git, etc). It does work with remote files.\n4. You can expose/hide tasks with [internal flag](https://taskfile.dev/usage/#internal-tasks)\n\n## Now the best part - cache\n\nPay a close look on the install task.\n\n1. it only runs if `package.json` and `package-lock.json` are present ([programatic checks](https://taskfile.dev/usage/#using-programmatic-checks-to-cancel-the-execution-of-a-task-and-its-dependencies))\n2. [Prevent unnecessary work](https://taskfile.dev/usage/#prevent-unnecessary-work): it caches the execution using the `source` attribute.\n3. at the end it checks if the `node_modules` folder was created.\n4. Even caching based on the `source`, if you remove the `node_modules` folder (check) it will run again.\n\nSo, you just need to run your daily tasks (e.g. tests, lints, run local) and the script itself will detect what is pending and run it if needed.\n\nNo more crazy issues that you forgot to update a dependency or database change.\n\n## Ok, show me a normal day of work\n\nAt the first time, you just need to run `task r` to run the app. It will install dependencies, start database, apply db changes and run the app.\n\nBut what happen if someone changes a dependency? No problem. Taskfile will detect and will run `npm install` again.\n\nBut if someone just changes the db schema? No problem. It will generate the classes again.\n\nIf nothing changes, it will just run the app (ok, the docker part is not optimized, but you got the idea).\n\nIf need to stop the app and run again you can go direct to `task ro` (ro = run only).\n\n## Full Project\n\nAs always, the full sample is available on [github](https://github.com/adamatti/node-sample).\n\n## Closing thoughts\n\nNow go to the [documentation](https://taskfile.dev/usage/).\n\nRemove commands from `README.md` files and confluence/sharepoint. Also remove it from anemic `package.json` 😛\n\nMy global taskfiles are shared [here](https://github.com/adamatti/dotfiles/tree/main/taskfile) for reference.\n\nMy backup scripts using rsync are also on taskfiles, but this is a subject for another post.\n\n"},{"slug":"2024-04-08-makefile","title":"Makefiles - How to use them for automations","summary":"A 5 minutes tutorial","dateString":"2024-04-08","tags":["javascript","typescript","tools"],"content":"\nImagine the follow scenario: you do have a node api with typescript, that uses a database (postgres in this sample) and an orm ([prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)). Every time someone in the team adds a new dependency, you need to run `npm install`. \n\nDatabase changes? You need to generate the classes again with `npm run prisma generate`. Oh, you also need to apply the changes with `npm run prisma db push` (note: a real world project would use migrations files, so `npm run prisma migrate dev`).\n\nThen you moved to another service. Then moved back... oh, now need to start database again with `docker-compose up -d`. And so one... \n\nThe steps are documented in a readme file. Or you can get it from `package.json` -> `scripts`, but there is no comments there or command order/dependence. \n\nWhat do you do? \n\n#### Makefile to rescue\n\nSo, Make is a build automation tool (thanks [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)), and it is available by default in all unix systems.\n\nWith that you can:\n- create goals (tasks)\n- create multi line commands\n- use vars\n- use conditions\n- create aliases for the commands\n- map task dependencies\n- avoid re-running a task if artifact is already created (e.g. build). \"Kind\" of a cache (strong quotes here)\n\n#### So, show me a sample!\n\nSure... check this one (full project [here](https://github.com/adamatti/node-sample)):\n\n```makefile\ndefault:\n\t@echo \"Please specify a target to run\"\n\nclean:\n\trm -rf node_modules\n\nnode_modules:\n\tnpm install\n\ndocker-compose-up:\n\tdocker-compose up -d\n\nprisma-db-push:\n\tnpx --yes wait-on tcp:5432 && \\\n\tDATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:sample@localhost:5432/sample npm run prisma db push\n\nprisma-generate:\n\tnpm run prisma generate\n\nrun-only:\n\tDATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:sample@localhost:5432/sample \\\n\tnpx --yes esno src/index.ts\n\nrun: docker-compose-up prisma-generate prisma-db-push run-only\n\nformat:\n\tnpm run prisma format\n\tnpx --yes biome format --write ./src\n\n# Aliases\ninstall: node_modules\ndcu: docker-compose-up\npdp: prisma-db-push\npg: prisma-generate\nr: run\nro: run-only\nfirst: clean install run\nfresh: first\nf: fresh\n```\n\nAs you can see, a simple task is just \n\n```makefile\ntaskname: dependency1 dependency2\n    my list of commands\n    second command here\n    etc\n```\n\nwith the sample provided, I can install dependencies with `make node_modules`. \n\nIf you run it again, it will do nothing as the `node_modules` folder is already present (task name = folder name).\n\nIf I want to run my app the first time, I just need `make fresh`, and it will:\n- install dependencies\n- start database\n- generate orm classes\n- update database\n- run the app\n\nIf I want to run the app again, I don't need the full steps. I can go direct to `make run-only`.\n\n#### Ok, I am lazy than that\n\nWith dependencies, you can create aliases. e.g.\n\n```makefile\nr: run\nro: run-only\n```\n\nNow I just need `make r` to run my app. Or `make ro` to run-only.\nNote: I am lazier than that, I also [have an alias](https://github.com/adamatti/dotfiles/blob/bb23c786a3181b977874efe83530b65ec5de804a/zsh/aliases.zsh#L3) to run `make` with `m` only 😛\n\n#### How about the default task?\n\nIt uses the first task. Or the one defined on `.DEFAULT_GOAL := help` (add it as one of the first lines).\n\n#### Ok, but how about documentation\n\nThere is a [trick](https://marmelab.com/blog/2016/02/29/auto-documented-makefile.html) for that - just add those lines in the beginning of the file:\n\n```makefile\n.PHONY: help\n\nhelp:\n\t@grep -E '^[a-zA-Z_-]+:.*?## .*$$' $(MAKEFILE_LIST) | sort | awk 'BEGIN {FS = \":.*?## \"}; {printf \"\\033[36m%-30s\\033[0m %s\\n\", $$1, $$2}'\n```\n\n...plus, `## comment` in the tasks you want comments. E.g.\n\n```makefile\nclean: ## remove dependencies\n\trm -rf node_modules\n\nprisma-generate: ## generate prisma classes\n\tnpm run prisma generate\n```\n\nNow you just need to run `make` or `make help` to see all tasks and comments, sorted by task name, e.g.\n\n```shell\n> make help\nclean                          remove dependencies\ndocker-compose-up              start dependencies\nfirst                          first execution\nformat                         format code\nfresh                          fresh execution\ninstall                        install dependencies\nprisma-db-push                 push prisma schema to database\nprisma-generate                generate prisma classes\nrun-only                       run the project\nrun                            run the project + dependencies\n```\n\n#### Advanced\n\n- How to hide the command from output? Just add `@` in the front of the command.\n- call an existing task in the middle/end of my commands? `$(MAKE) your task`\n- cache task? the task should match with the output folder or file name\n\n#### Show me the full project\n\nIt is [here](https://github.com/adamatti/node-sample), and the makefile is [here](https://github.com/adamatti/node-sample/blob/main/Makefile)\n\n#### Why post about makefile?\n\nBecause this is the [most watched video on my channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4aV3C6BRDQ). And a lot of developers still adding commands on readme files on partially on package.json. We developers should automate things, even our daily tasks."}]},"__N_SSG":true}
