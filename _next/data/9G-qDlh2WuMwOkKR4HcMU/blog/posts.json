Every time someone in the team adds a new dependency, you need to run `npm install`. \n\nDatabase changes? You need to generate the classes again with `npm run prisma generate`. Oh, you also need to apply the changes with `npm run prisma db push` (note: a real world project would use migrations files, so `npm run prisma migrate dev`).\n\nThen you moved to another service. Then moved back... oh, now need to start database again with `docker-compose up -d`. And so one... \n\nThe steps are documented in a readme file. Or you can get it from `package.json` -> `scripts`, but there is no comments there or command order/dependence. \n\nWhat do you do? \n\n#### Makefile to rescue\n\nSo, Make is a build automation tool (thanks [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)), and it is available by default in all unix systems.\n\nWith that you can:\n- create goals (tasks)\n- create multi line commands\n- use vars\n- use conditions\n- create aliases for the commands\n- map task dependencies\n- avoid re-running a task if artifact is already created (e.g. build). \"Kind\" of a cache (strong quotes here)\n\n#### So, show me a sample!\n\nSure... check this one (full project [here](https://github.com/adamatti/node-sample)):\n\n```makefile\ndefault:\n\t@echo \"Please specify a target to run\"\n\nclean:\n\trm -rf node_modules\n\nnode_modules:\n\tnpm install\n\ndocker-compose-up:\n\tdocker-compose up -d\n\nprisma-db-push:\n\tnpx --yes wait-on tcp:5432 && \\\n\tDATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:sample@localhost:5432/sample npm run prisma db push\n\nprisma-generate:\n\tnpm run prisma generate\n\nrun-only:\n\tDATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:sample@localhost:5432/sample \\\n\tnpx --yes esno src/index.ts\n\nrun: docker-compose-up prisma-generate prisma-db-push run-only\n\nformat:\n\tnpm run prisma format\n\tnpx --yes biome format --write ./src\n\n# Aliases\ninstall: node_modules\ndcu: docker-compose-up\npdp: prisma-db-push\npg: prisma-generate\nr: run\nro: run-only\nfirst: clean install run\nfresh: first\nf: fresh\n```\n\nAs you can see, a simple task is just \n\n```makefile\ntaskname: dependency1 dependency2\n    my list of commands\n    second command here\n    etc\n```\n\nwith the sample provided, I can install dependencies with `make node_modules`. \n\nIf you run it again, it will do nothing as the `node_modules` folder is already present (task name = folder name).\n\nIf I want to run my app the first time, I just need `make fresh`, and it will:\n- install dependencies\n- start database\n- generate orm classes\n- update database\n- run the app\n\nIf I want to run the app again, I don't need the full steps. I can go direct to `make run-only`.\n\n#### Ok, I am lazy than that\n\nWith dependencies, you can create aliases. e.g.\n\n```makefile\nr: run\nro: run-only\n```\n\nNow I just need `make r` to run my app. Or `make ro` to run-only.\nNote: I am lazier than that, I also [have an alias](https://github.com/adamatti/dotfiles/blob/bb23c786a3181b977874efe83530b65ec5de804a/zsh/aliases.zsh#L3) to run `make` with `m` only ðŸ˜›\n\n#### How about the default task?\n\nIt uses the first task. Or the one defined on `.DEFAULT_GOAL := help` (add it as one of the first lines).\n\n#### Ok, but how about documentation\n\nThere is a [trick](https://marmelab.com/blog/2016/02/29/auto-documented-makefile.html) for that - just add those lines in the beginning of the file:\n\n```makefile\n.PHONY: help\n\nhelp:\n\t@grep -E '^[a-zA-Z_-]+:.*?## .*$$' $(MAKEFILE_LIST) | sort | awk 'BEGIN {FS = \":.*?## \"}; {printf \"\\033[36m%-30s\\033[0m %s\\n\", $$1, $$2}'\n```\n\n...plus, `## comment` in the tasks you want comments. E.g.\n\n```makefile\nclean: ## remove dependencies\n\trm -rf node_modules\n\nprisma-generate: ## generate prisma classes\n\tnpm run prisma generate\n```\n\nNow you just need to run `make` or `make help` to see all tasks and comments, sorted by task name, e.g.\n\n```shell\n> make help\nclean                          remove dependencies\ndocker-compose-up              start dependencies\nfirst                          first execution\nformat                         format code\nfresh                          fresh execution\ninstall                        install dependencies\nprisma-db-push                 push prisma schema to database\nprisma-generate                generate prisma classes\nrun-only                       run the project\nrun                            run the project + dependencies\n```\n\n#### Advanced\n\n- How to hide the command from output? Just add `@` in the front of the command.\n- call an existing task in the middle/end of my commands? `$(MAKE) your task`\n- cache task? the task should match with the output folder or file name\n\n#### Show me the full project\n\nIt is [here](https://github.com/adamatti/node-sample), and the makefile is [here](https://github.com/adamatti/node-sample/blob/main/Makefile)\n\n#### Why post about makefile?\n\nBecause this is the [most watched video on my channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4aV3C6BRDQ). And a lot of developers still adding commands on readme files on partially on package.json. We developers should automate things, even our daily tasks."},{"slug":"2024-04-05-vinejs","title":"Vinejs - js validation lib","summary":"An alternative to zod","dateString":"2024-04-05","tags":["javascript","typescript"],"content":"\nJust saw this new lib today - [Vinejs](https://vinejs.dev/).

The commands to make it run using native binary are on this [gist](https://gist.github.com/adamatti/4633a7559647aaf779d60e3aad543b6b).\n\nToday I tried it again, just registering here my steps:\n\n### 1. Install quarkus\n\nI am using [sdkman](https://sdkman.io/) for it - it is a java version manager, similar to [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) (for node).\n\nIt is easy as `sdk install quarkus`.\n\n### 2. Create a project\n\nJust need to run:\n\n```shell\nquarkus create app adamatti.github.io:learn-quarkus --extension='resteasy-reactive' --gradle\n```\n\nWhere `learn-quarkus` is the project name and `adamatti.github.io` is the main package name.\n\nYes, I decided to use [gradle](https://gradle.org/) instead of [maven](https://maven.apache.org/). Not willing to use XML in 2023 :-p\n\nThen I added this extension to build inside a docker container: \n\n```shell\ngradle addExtension --extensions=quarkus-container-image-docker\n```\n\n### 3. Run\n\n`./gradlew quarkusDev`. I can't deny, it is amazing be able to change source files without the need to stop/start the application multiple times\n\n### 4. Build native\n\n```shell\n./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.type=native -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true\n```\n\nWith this, you don't need to have [graalvm](https://www.graalvm.org/) on local machine.\n\nThe binary file was created on `build` folder as `learn-quarkus-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`. It took ~4mins on my machine (Apple M1), 40mb is the size.\n\n### 5. Run the binary in a docker container\n\n... just to make sure it doesn't need any of the dependencies in my local machine (e.g. java) and simulate a real deploy.\n\n```shell\ndocker run --rm -it \\\n    -p \"8080:8080\" \\\n    -v ${PWD}/build/learn-quarkus-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner:/app \\\n    centos \\\n    /app -Dquarkus.http.host=0.0.0.0\n```\n\n### Extra - version configuration\n\nJust created a `.sdkmanrc` file to make sure I would use the same versions in the future: \n\n```shell\n# Enable auto-env through the sdkman_auto_env config\n# Add key=value pairs of SDKs to use below\njava=11.0.11.9.1-amzn\ngradle=7.5.1\nquarkus=3.0.0.Alpha6\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\n1. Quarkus is really fast, I would love to work with it in production\n2. Really loved the way the resources/controllers are created, e.g. \n\n```java\npackage adamatti.github.io;\n\nimport javax.ws.rs.GET;\nimport javax.ws.rs.Path;\nimport javax.ws.rs.Produces;\nimport javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;\n\n@Path(\"/hello\")\npublic class GreetingResource {\n\n    @GET\n    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)\n    public String hello() {\n        return \"Hello from RESTEasy Reactive\";\n    }\n}\n```\n\n3. Loved the tests created with Gherkin syntax: \n\n```java\npackage adamatti.github.io;\n\nimport io.quarkus.test.junit.QuarkusTest;\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\n\nimport static io.restassured.RestAssured.given;\nimport static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.is;\n\n@QuarkusTest\npublic class GreetingResourceTest {\n\n    @Test\n    public void testHelloEndpoint() {\n        given()\n          .when().get(\"/hello\")\n          .then()\n             .statusCode(200)\n             .body(is(\"Hello from RESTEasy Reactive\"));\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\n4. It also create tests for the native version (powered by the additional annotation):\n\n```java\npackage adamatti.github.io;\n\nimport io.quarkus.test.junit.QuarkusIntegrationTest;\n\n@QuarkusIntegrationTest\npublic class GreetingResourceIT extends GreetingResourceTest {\n    // Execute the same tests but in packaged mode.\n}\n```\n\n5. [Micronault](https://micronaut.io/) is still my prefered [spring](https://spring.io/) replacement, but this is a subject for another topic.\n\nI still curious about Quarkus usage, let's keep watching and see how does it goes."},{"slug":"2023-03-15-chatgpt-full-potential","title":"How to unlock ChatGPT full potential","summary":"a great prompt for better results","dateString":"2023-03-15","tags":["chatgpt"],"content":"\nJust received it on [this newsletter](https://atalho.substack.com/p/597-o-prompt-dos-prompts-como-desbloquear), it is helping me a lot for better prompts:\n\n```\nI want you to become my prompt engineer.
