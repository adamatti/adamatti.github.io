Develop at lightspeed with our Docker Desktop alternative\n\nIt is fully compatible, so no drastic changes.\n\nYou can check the [Docker x OrbStack comparison](https://docs.orbstack.dev/compare/docker-desktop), [Colima x OrbStack](https://docs.orbstack.dev/compare/colima) or [a review from @vortj](https://medium.com/@vortj/orbstack-review-a-game-changer-for-macos-developers-f1931a9db227).\n\nIf you want to fully uninstall docker desktop you can do it [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/uninstall/).\n\nIt also provides [kubernetes features](https://docs.orbstack.dev/kubernetes/), but I am using [kind](/blog/posts/2024-10-22-kind) for that.\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
